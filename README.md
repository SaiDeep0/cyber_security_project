Steganography is the practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret text or data. The term is derived from the Greek words "steganos," meaning "covered or concealed," and "graphein," meaning "to write."

Image Steganography: Embedding a message within an image by altering the least significant bits (LSB) of pixel values. This method is popular because it can conceal large amounts of data without noticeably changing the image.

Features:
Encoding: Embeds a text message into the least significant bits of image pixels.
Decoding: Retrieves hidden messages from encoded images without visibly altering the image.

Key Components:
Python Scripts: Includes scripts for encoding (encode.py) and decoding (decode.py) text messages into/from images.
Sample Images: Provides sample images for testing and demonstration purposes.
